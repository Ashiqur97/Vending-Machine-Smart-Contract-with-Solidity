# Vending-Machine-Smart-Contract-with-Solidity

Vending machine is an interesting thing to get you started with the basics of Solidity. So, we are going to write a code in Solidity that will help us build a smart contract for a Lizy Vending Machine!

In this title you will learn all the things needed to build a Lizy's Vending Machine using solidity programming language. You will gain a whole host of practical experience/technical skills with vending smart contract, as well as theoretical within this title.

• Introduction to Vending Machine
• Variable
• Function and Function Visibility types (Private) etc
• Get Balance Function
• Purchase Function
• Restock Function
• Compiling our Smart Contract
• Deploying our Smart Contract
• Conclusion

A vending machine is an automated machine that provides items such as snacks, beverages, cigarettes, and lottery tickets to consumers after cash, a credit card, or other forms of payment are inserted into the machine or otherwise made.

Let us start off by going to Remix which is an IDE for the language of Solidity. 
It is used to write Smart Contracts for the Blockchain. 
In terms of implementation coding for ERC-20 tokens, 
the six basic coding functions are: 

get Balance
Purchase
Restock
